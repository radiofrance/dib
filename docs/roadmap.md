Roadmap
=======

## Road to v1

DIB is still a work in progress, but we plan to release a stable version (v1.0.0) after we have added the 
following features:

- **Per-image configuration:** Some images may require their own tagging scheme. Being 
    able to configure those settings for each image is necessary.


## Future additions

- **Multiplatform builds**: Ability to build images for different platforms, and generate a manifest-list.
- **Image signing**: Sign images to improve supply chain security.

And more...
