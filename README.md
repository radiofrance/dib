DIB is a tool designed to help build multiple Docker images defined within a directory, possibly having dependencies
with one another, in a single command.

## Features

- **Incremental Builds:** Images are only built when something has changed since the last build, saving time and resources.
- **Dependency Resolution:** Supports dependencies between images. Builds will be queued until all parent images are built, ensuring a smooth and efficient build process.
- **Test Suites:** Run test suites on images and ensure the tests pass before promoting images to production.
- **Build Backends:** Multiple build backends supported, including Docker/BuildKit and Kaniko. Choose the backend that best suits your needs.
- **Execution Environments:** DIB supports multiple executors, allowing you to build images using different environments such as Shell, Docker, or Kubernetes.
