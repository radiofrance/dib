DIB (Docker Image Builder) is a tool to build multiple Docker images hosted within the same repository.

# Concepts

First, DIB creates a graph representation of all Dockerfiles in the repository with their dependencies. 
Imagine you have the following Dockerfiles in your repository (you can see this example in the `test/fixtures` directory).
Each image in a subfolder depends on the image in its parent directory (e.g. `sub-image` has a `FROM bullseye` instruction)

```
└── bullseye
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── external-parent
    │   └── Dockerfile
    ├── multistage
    │   └── Dockerfile
    ├── skipbuild
    │   └── Dockerfile
    └── sub-image
        └── Dockerfile
```

Then, DIB will check the git diff between the current version of your repository and the previous one. 

To calculate this "previous" version, DIB use a file called `.docker-version` stored in the docker build directory.
The content of this file is a unique hash of the docker directoy, generated by `dib hash`. 

Then, for each dockerfile, if its was changed since the last update, it is taggued for rebuild. The tag of this newly
built image is the result of `dib hash`. If the image is unchanged, a new tag is created from the previous tag.

# Installation

First, install the cli

```
go install github.com/radiofrance/dib@latest
```

Dib uses a "referential" image to store metadata about previous runs. This image needs to be present on the remote 
registry. A bootstrap dockerfile is present in the `init` directory with the instructions to build it.

# Initialisation

DIB requires a "meta" docker image to store metadata on previous dib builds. By default, dib expects an image named
`dib-referential` to be present on the registry. If you choose to use another name than `dib-referential`, you will need
to set it in your command-line, with `--referential-image`, or in the dib config file.

The `init` folder helps setup this image. It contains a simple minimalist Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t <your_registry_url>/dib-referential init
docker push <your_registry_url>/dib-referential
```
